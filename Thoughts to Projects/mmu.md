# Carriage Driven MMU
## What it is 
Create an mmu system similar to the Trad Rack, Enraged Rabbit, and Prusa mmu but such that the selector is driven by the x carriage.  First thoughts are that the x carriage would somehow key into a slot that drives the motion of filament selector on the mmu.

### What are the advantage and disadvantages of such a system?
Could possibly eat into work space on the build platform
Reduces stepper motor count
Incorporated into current ecosystem making it default...
Does this add complexity to an already complex system?
