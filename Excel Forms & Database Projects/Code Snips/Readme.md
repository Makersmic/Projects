Use these bits of VBA code like i do, cheat sheats.  These are a collection of vba macros that i find useful for the projects i create for home and professional use.
Some of my past projects include things like creating a cataloging system for a manufacturing plants tooling, automated forms applying chain of command email messaging services,
automated setup forms, as well as vba code to support a wide a variety of functions

Most of these for the time being are going to macros that i have used in the past or are currently using, and some crated by chatgpt with instruction and modification by myself.
